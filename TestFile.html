I want to make this the help file for the GIT bash:

git clone "url"          - To clone the repository to the local folder, the current folder
git status               - To know the latest status of the repository like what are the changes made
git add "filename"       - Add the file to the git (not to the repository yet)
git add -A               - Add all the files to the git
git commit -m "comments" - Commit the changes (not yet uploaded to the github on internet)
git push                 - Push all the changes to github repository (asks for uname pwd)
git pull                 - Its like get updated version to the repository
git config --global user.name "user name" - To set the name of the user in GIT
